## User API Documentation
This application can be used to save call detail records and get the bills associated with them by your convenience. It calculates monthly bills for a given telephone number.

<a id="get-telephone-bill"></a>
### Get telephone bill

Returns calls records for a single number and period of month/year.
The telephone bill itself is composed by subscriber and period
attributes and a list of all call records of the period.

<a id="notes"></a>
#### Notes

- If the reference period is not informed the system will consider the last closed period, aka the previous month. 
- It's only possible to get a telephone bill after the reference period has ended.
- A call record belongs to the period in which the call has ended (eg. A call that started on January 31st and finished in February 1st belongs to February
period).

<a id="save-telephone-call-detail-records"></a>
### Save telephone call detail records

Saves call details from sent call records. There are two call detailed record types: Call Start Record and Call End Record. To save all information of a telephone call you should send the records pair.

#### Notes

- Each Record Start and End must always be sent in separated requests.
- You application should check for 204 code status to verify the record was saved correctly. 
- You MUST send the timestamp in UTC timezone, do any convertion timezone conversion needed in your end.

## App Documentation
If you're a developer trying to understand better this app or modify it, use this section to learn more.

This is a Python application using the Django framework and Django Rest Framework. It can be used as is or modified as you wish.

<a id="requirements"></a>
### Requirements
- Python3

<a id="install-instructions"></a>
### Install Instructions
Bellow you will find instructions to install and run the app locally as well as deploying in Heroku. It's convenient to use a virtual environment to install Python modules, if you're not familiar with it, read about it here: [venv â€” Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

1. Enter in your workspace directory
2. Create a virtual env directory: `$ mkdir venvs`
3. Create the virtual env: `$ python3 -m venv python/venvs/calldetail`
4. Activate the virtual env: `$ source venvs/calldetail/bin/activate`
5. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/maximiliano/work-at-olist`
6. `$ cd work-at-olist`
7. Install dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Define a secret key by assigning the `CD_SECRET_KEY` enviroment variable, either via export command or or adding them to your shell initialization file, you can generate a random string like this: ``$ export CD_SECRET_KEY=`openssl rand -base64 12` ``
9. Configure your database:
  - If you're going to use sqlite you can just run the migrations:  `$ python manage.py migrate`
  - Else, you will need a few extra steps:
  - Create the data base in your choosen database: `> CREATE DATABASE calldetails;` (or another name you choose)
  - Assign these enviroment variables, either via export command or or adding them to your shell initialization file:
  - `$ export CD_DB_ENGINE=<your engine, like mysql or postgres>`
  - `$ export CD_DB_NAME=calldetails`
  - `$ export CD_DB_USER=<your db user>`
  - `$ export CD_DB_PASSWORD=<your user password>`
  - `$ export CD_DB_HOST=<localhost or other host>`
  - `$ export CD_DB_PORT=<your db port>`
  - To know more about django database configuration see this: [Dabatase Settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#databases)
  - Run migrations: `$ python manage.py migrate`
10. Run the local server to test: `$ python manage.py runserver`
11. If you see the message "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/" means everything is working!


#### Debug Mode

If you want to see the app in DEBUG mode you have to assign the `CD_DEBUG` enviroment variable to `true`: `$ export CD_DEBUG=true` (Don't need to put quotes, it still is a string value).

Run the export command before running the server or add it to your shell initialization file, commonly named `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`.

#### Testing
You can run the test suit with the command: `$ python -m pytest -vv`

<a id="heroku-deploy"></a>
### Heroku Deploy

If you want to deploy in Heroku, the app is all set up, you just need to run a few commands.

1. Log in your Heroku account: `$ heroku login`
2. Create your Heroku application: `$ heroku create`
3. Disable uneeded stuff: `$ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
4. Define a secret key by assigning the `CD_SECRET_KEY` enviroment variable, you can generate a random string like this: ``$ heroku config:set CD_SECRET_KEY=`openssl rand -base64 12` ``
5. Make sure you have only one dyno running: `$ heroku ps:scale web=1`
6. Send your code to heroku: `$ git push heroku master`
7. Run the migrations in Heroku, it will run in a PostgreSQL database, everything is already set up: `$ heroku run python manage.py migrate`
8. All done! Your app is running in Heroku

#### Debug Mode

If you want to see the app in DEBUG mode you have to assign the `CD_DEBUG` enviroment variable to `true`: `$ heroku config:set CD_DEBUG=true` (Don't need to put quotes, it still is a string value).

#### Checking Logs

You can check logs of running app with the commmand: `$ heroku logs --tail`

If the heroku deploy isn't working, refer to Heroku Docs on Python to learn more: [Getting Started on Heroku with Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) and [Deploying Python and Django Apps on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python).
